# SQL_Project:

Here, I performed a comprehensive analysis of the employee status within an organization. This process involved the following key steps:</br>
1) <b><i>Database Creation:</b></i> Designed and structured a database to accurately represent the organizational hierarchy and employee details.</br>
2) <b><i>Data Entry:</b></i> Entered relevant data into the respective tables, ensuring accuracy and consistency across all records.</br>
3) <b><i>Query Execution:</b></i> Formulated and executed SQL queries to answer a series of predefined questions about the organization’s employees. These queries provided valuable insights into various aspects of the workforce, such as demographics, performance metrics, and departmental distribution.
